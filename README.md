# Clustering Elementary Schools with K-Means

This project is an example of applying the K-Means Clustering algorithm to elementary school data in Indonesia.

## Project Structure

- `K-Means.py` — Main script for performing clustering on the dataset.
- `dataset.csv` — Elementary school dataset to be processed.
- `.gitattributes` — Git attribute settings.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the `dataset.csv` file in the same directory as `K-Means.py`.
3. Run the script with the following command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    python K-Means.py
    ```

4. The clustering results will be displayed in the terminal.

## Brief Explanation

The [`K-Means.py`](K-Means.py) script reads data from [`dataset.csv`](dataset.csv), then performs clustering using the K-Means algorithm to group elementary schools based on the features available in the dataset.
